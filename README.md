## About the Project

This application search for gifs using the giphy api. The application searches for gifs as user types. The gifs are animated in such a way that when user hovers over it, the opacity is reduced.

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
  	components/
  		App.js
    index.css
    index.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`

After cloing / downloading all the files from github, run npm install to install all the dependencies.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`
